# Library-Database with basic search function

This project uses searching and sorting functionality for library datasets. 
<br /> <br /> I have to use multiple data structures and compare the performance of different search methods and sorting methods. I also use a larger dataset to be able to measure results (booksdatabasenew2.csv).
- must be built in Python.
